# spotify-playlist-downloder
Free Spotify playlist downloader, made using Python

## Introduction
This is a tool which lets you download a Spotify playlist, without paying for Spotify Premium. 
Compared to other Spotify playlist downloaders, this version is much more lightweight, and small.
`main.py` is where all the magic happens. The code lets you input a Spotify playlist link.
The songs from the playlist are analyzed, and then we use `pytube` to search for the song from YouTube.
The first result is then downloaded.
